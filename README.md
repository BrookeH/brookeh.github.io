### Why not use framework X?

While I have experience with various frameworks such as [angular](https://angular.io) and [react](https://reactjs.org), I am a firm believer in using the right tool for the job. For a fairly minimal static site like this I do not believe that a framework would offer enough benefit to warrant their additional overhead at this time.
