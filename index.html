        <h3>University Radio York</h3>
        <p>
          When I first joined URY their site was quite dated. It was not
          responsive, and it used a legacy stack that was difficult to maintain.
          To make matters worse it was heavilty tied to the database rather than
          the stations in house CMS
          <a href="https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/MyRadio">MyRadio</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A project had already been started by the computing team to rewrite
          the site, however it was in its infancy and didn't have any designs. I
          took it upon myself to spend the summer designing what I thought the
          new site should look like. These designs were well recieved by the
          society and we got the green light to turn them into a reality. Myself
          and the rest of the computing team evolved the designs and turned them
          into the site that exists today.

        <h3>Days Until</h3>
        <p>
          A simple app that allows you to have a list of events and time until
          that event. Keep track of your busy life. This app allows you to note
          down events and activities and countdown the days until the event.
          Super simple but effective.
