        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>I am a third-year Computer Science student at the University of York, currently on a industrial placement at Morgan
          Stanley, where I am expanding on my experience in Java server side development and building user interfaces with
          Angular and Typescript. I am extremely passionate about user experience and design, constantly looking for ways
          to improve the products that I make.</p>
        <p>As a child, I was always taking things apart to understand how they work and as I have gotten older this hasn't changed,
          although, things usually work when I put them back together now. I am passionate and committed to my work, I enjoy
          seeing a problem through and working out a solution. Above all, I enjoy working in a team that is creative and
          enthusiastic about tasks and in which we all have our own individual strengths. I enjoy and excel in taking the
          time to sculpt an idea considering the users at every stage of the process.</p>

        <h3>Newark and Retford Toys</h3>
        <p>
          East Midlands Toy Company asked me to design a simple site that would display basic contact details and maps to their customers
          for both their Neward and Retford branches. This site was built in 2014 intended to be a bridge to fill the gap
          before an online store was made available.
          <ul>
            <li>Responsive design</li>
            <li>One click call, email and Directions on most modern smartphones</li>

        <h3>East Midlands Toy Company - Sales sheet</h3>
        <p>
          During my time as a sales assistant at their Melton Mowbray branch, I noticed that to record the sales of each store at the
          end of they day, they would write the information down on a sheet of paper and then at the end of each month, someone
          would go through that months worth of paper documents and type it into an excel spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>
          This had lots of room for human error. It was also very time consuming; having to manually calculate parts of the information
          write it down and then have someone digitize it. Working with the company I designed and created a online system
          that would allow them to digitally enter the sales for each store at the end of each day and run reports on this
          data.
