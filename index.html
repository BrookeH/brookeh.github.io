      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently working at Morgan Stanley as a Full Stack Software
        Engineer with a preference for UI/UX development.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a child, I was always taking things apart to understand how they work
        and as I have gotten older this hasn't changed, although, things usually
        work when I put them back together now. I am passionate and committed to
        my work, I enjoy seeing a problem through and working out a solution.
        Above all, I enjoy working in a team that is creative and enthusiastic
        about tasks and in which we all have our own individual strengths. I
        enjoy and excel in taking the time to sculpt an idea, and considering
        the users at every stage of the process.

        <h3>Days Until</h3>
        <p>
          A simple app that allows you to have a list of events and time until
          that event. Keep track of your busy life. This app allows you to note
          down events and activities and countdown the days until the event.
          Super simple but effective.
